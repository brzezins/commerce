E-commerce project
=================


Just another responsive e-commerce website template inspired (not converted 1 to 1) [this](http://www.freepik.com/free-psd/premium-ecommerce-website-template-psd_693630.htm) PSD file.
What I used to convert a PSD file into working responsive website?

 - HTML5, CSS, jQuery
 - Customized Bootstrap:  Grid system, Responsive utilities, Carousel
